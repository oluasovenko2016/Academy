 <h1>Philip Emeagwali</h1>

 <div>Philip Emeagwali is a Nigerian <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/programs/computer-science/">computer scientist</a>. He has been living in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom/"> United States</a></div>
 <div> for many years.[1] He won the 1989 <a href="https://awards.acm.org/bell/"> Gordon Bell Prize</a> ($1,000) for price-performance in</div>
 <div> high-performance computing applications, in an oil reservoir modeling calculation using a</div>
 <div> novel mathematical formulation and implementation.[2][3]</div>

 <h2>Biography</h2>

 <div>Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended in</div> 
 <div>1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the </div>
 <div>war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.</div>
 <div>is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]</div> 

<h2>Education</h2>

<div>He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a</div>
<div>correspondence course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in</div>
<div>mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving</div>
<div>in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering,</div>
<div>and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine</div>
<div>suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this time, he worked as a</div>
<div>civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.</div>

<h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>

<div>Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. </div>
<div>His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was</div>
<div>not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a </div> 
<div>violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated against him in several ways</div>
<div>because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state</div> 
<div>Court of Appeals.[8]</div> 

<h2>Supercomputing</h2>

<div>Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel</div>
<div>computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling.</div>
<div>He received a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400</div> 
<div>Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category, was also the winner of the</div>  
<div>Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking</div>   
<div>Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500</div>    
<div>Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each</div>     
<div>microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]</div>     
<div>microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]</div>

<div>Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir</div> 
<div>modeling.[1]</div>
